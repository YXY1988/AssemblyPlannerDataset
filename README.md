# AssemblyPlannerDataset

Dataset with CAD models for testing disassembly planning systems.

The 3D models were improved for ensuring that:
- There are no CAD interferences between parts
- The part names match their official designation (present in the [assembly / repair manuals](https://github.com/carlosmccosta/Assembly-Named-Entity-Recognition))

We would like to express our great appreciation for the excellent work done by the authors of each CAD model present in this dataset.
